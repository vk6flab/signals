# Signals

Ever wanted to have some example files to decode whilst learning how to use a new tool, like [Universal Radio Hacker](https://github.com/jopohl/urh), or [multimon-ng](https://github.com/EliasOenal/multimon-ng).

Feel free to add a decode as an issue and I'll update the documentation.

Similarly, if you have an interesting file in whatever format, feel free to add a pull request.

Have fun.
