# Signals

Ever wanted to have some example files to decode whilst learning how to use a new tool, like [Universal Radio Hacker](https://github.com/jopohl/urh), or [multimon-ng](https://github.com/EliasOenal/multimon-ng).

Feel free to add a decode as an issue and I'll update the documentation.

Similarly, if you have an interesting file in whatever format, feel free to add a pull request.

Have fun.

* __cw.25wpm.600Hz.wav__ - the first few minutes of an ebook2cw generated version of an amateur radio podcast. -- Onno VK6FLAB

## recorded

The files in this folder are recorded off-air and are intended to test your decoding skills.

* __gqrx_20250614_225144_7060000.wav__ - Captured with gqrx demodulating the signal as SSB audio with the VFO tuned to 7.060, so both "signals" are there, one very low freq and one very high freq. -- Randal VK6WR
